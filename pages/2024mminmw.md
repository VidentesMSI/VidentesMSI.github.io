In June 2024, _Videntes,_ a collective comprised of four scholars whose academic training varies from Medieval History, Literature, Art History, and Digital Humanities will collaborate with the _Museo del Tesoro e Archivio Capitolare_ (MTD) in Vercelli, Italy to launch the first **Digital Humanities Institute in Vercelli.** Beginning June 16th, 2024, fifteen to twenty participants will engage in five days of workshops, lectures, and labs designed around materials held by the Archives and the Museum. The institute will offer unprecedented access to medieval art and archival documents that have shaped the course of medieval and modern learning.

Before and After MSI processing on one of the Vercelli Scrolls

The Museo del Tesoro e Archivio Capitolare (MTD) in Vercelli, Italy preserves a spectacular collection of medieval and early modern manuscripts ranging from a 4th-century Gospel Book, to a 10th-century book of Old English poems, and seven 13th-century scrolls that were likely used in a medieval schoolroom. These objects, their protection, and their continued examination reflect a centuries-long commitment to the production and dissemination of knowledge. _Videntes_: _A Multispectral Imaging Collective_ was established in 2022 after a successful multispectral imaging (MSI) campaign at the MTD. The campaign resulted in an exciting collaboration of scholars who had previously been working independently on at least one of the seven scrolls mentioned above. As a participant of the Institute, you will learn about the various stages (and tools) of a DH project life cycle, meet like-minded international scholars, and experience a truly collaborative DH team at work.
