## About This Item
(From left to right) Helen Davies, Evan Gatti, Heather Wacha, Silvia Faccin, and Katie Albers-Morris pause for a photo in the Chapter Room of the Archivio Capitolare in Vercelli, Italy Summer 2022). During a week of intense work, were were able to image the front and back of the Mappa Mundi and Scroll with the Apostles, as well as the front of the Ecclesia Scroll and the back of the Scroll with Writings by Joachim of Fiore. The process of imaging each carta involves taking 24 to 36 seperate shots that we will later process and stitch together in photoshop. Each shot includes 12 different light bands, so the process takes time and sustained attention.
