## Publication: “Multispectral Imaging to Recover the Lost Text in the Sarajevo Haggadah”

_Videntes_ team member Katie Albers-Morris has published an article with Aleksandra Buncic and Gregory Heyworth in the Journal of Cultural Heritage, describing the process of using MSI to image the Sarajevo Haggadah. The Sarajevo Haggadah is a Spanish illuminated manuscript that followed Jews expelled from Spain in the 14th century, and the MSI project has revealed a complete text of a sale contract that had been erased.
