Helen Davies, Katie Albers-Morris, Alex Zawacki, and Evan Gatti led an MSI workshop at the 2025 Digital Medieval Studies Institute following the IMC Leeds. This workshop introduced different levels of MSI capturing and processing, ranging from the more high-end systems to more affordable and portable systems like the MISHA, or Ghost Camera. Attendees also had the opportunity to learn how to use accessible processing systems like Hoku and r-Chive.
