_Videntes_ recently held the first Digital Humanities Institute in Vercelli. In collaboration with the _Museum Del Tesoro e Archivio Capitolare,_ our team was able to lead participants in five days of workshops, lectures, and labs to introduce them to MSI processing with medieval art and archival documents.
