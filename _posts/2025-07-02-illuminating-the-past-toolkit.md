A new MSI tool-kit project developed by Helen Davies with Prof. Larry Eames and Evangela Dudeck through the Center for Research Frontiers in the Digital Humanities at UCCS is now available online! This project aims to share an affordable MSI process, the Ghost Camera, to audiences beyond the traditional elite academic setting. Tool-kits offered by _Illuminating the Past_ will walk you through planning, implementing, and sharing your own cultural imaging and preservation projects.
