Katie Albers-Morris and Evan Gatti led a talk during the Digital Approaches to Materiality of Manuscripts, I: Classrooms session at the 2025 IMC Leeds. During this presentation Katie and Evan discussed how the Videntes team organized and held the 2024 Medieval Manuscripts in a Modern World DH institute in Vercelli. This included explaining the process of collaboration between Videntes and the Museo del Tesoro del Duomo and the Archivio Capitolare di Vercelli, and the different skills targeted by daily sessions.
