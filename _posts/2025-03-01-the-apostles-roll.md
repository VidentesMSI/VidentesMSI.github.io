## 

The _Videntes_ team has published an article together in a special issue of _Arte Cristiana_ 944. In this article, the team describes the _Rotolo con Atti Degli Apostoli_ of St. Eusebius Cathedral and how _Videntes_ uses MSI imaging to investigate the scroll and its connections to six other scrolls in the Archivio Capitolare, Vercelli.
